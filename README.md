# Endangered Species Tracking : EKF with Backstepping+PD Control  
  
## Introduction  
<p style="text-align: justify">
Backstepping and Proportional-Derivative (PD) methods was used for the control of a quadrotor unit and subsequently proposed for autonomous tracking of an endangered species; the ’Northern white rhino’. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimation was applied for the localization of the rhino in a virtual wildlife reserve. </p>
